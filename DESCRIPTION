Description: The package contains functions that effectively 
  and accurately classify crossbreed combinations of pigs based on genomic data. 
  The method is trained on purebred pigs and uses fuzzy classification 
  with the PLS-QDA method to classify the crosbreds pig, 
  described in detalis in Vinje et al. (2023). 
  The input is SNP data from crossbreed combination of pigs and 
  the output is classified breed combinations.
